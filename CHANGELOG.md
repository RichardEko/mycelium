## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Typed sub-handle facade** — `GossipAgent` now exposes six domain-scoped handles, each a zero-cost `Arc<TaskCtx>` clone: `KvHandle` (via `agent.kv()`), `MeshHandle` (via `agent.mesh()`), `CapabilitiesHandle` (via `agent.capabilities()`), `ConsensusHandle` (via `agent.consensus()`), `ServiceHandle` (via `agent.service()`), `SchemaHandle` (via `agent.schemas()`). All prior methods remain on `GossipAgent` as thin forwarding stubs.
- `gateway` Cargo feature (on by default) — gates the Axum HTTP server and its transitive deps (`axum`, `tower-http`, `tokio-stream`, `futures-util`). Disable with `default-features = false` for bare-metal / WASM embeds. All gossip, KV, signal, consensus, capability, and service APIs compile without `gateway`.
- `rust-toolchain.toml` — pins the toolchain to `stable`.

### Changed

- `set_quorum` renamed to `set_with_min_acks` — name now reflects the actual semantics (wait for N gossip echo receipts, not consensus quorum).
- Cargo.toml `description` improved: now accurately describes the three-layer substrate.
- `a2a` and `llm` features now imply `gateway` (they expose HTTP endpoints).

### Added

- `Capability::with_schema_id` / `CapFilter::with_schema` — optional contract version gossip-propagated with every capability entry. Resolvers that call `with_schema` only match providers advertising the same `schema_id`; capabilities without a `schema_id` do not match (strict by default).
- `Capability::with_input_schema` / `with_output_schema` — embed JSON Schema strings directly in the gossip-propagated capability entry so callers can inspect the invocation contract from `resolve()` results without a separate KV lookup. SkillRunner now embeds `.skill.toml` input/output schemas in the capability in addition to the existing `skills/.../input` KV keys.
- `GossipAgent::signal_rx_from(kind, trusted)` — delivers only signals whose `sender` is in the trusted list. Addresses the semantic-injection attack vector (arXiv 2511.19699 §5.1) for LLM-driven agents processing signal payloads as prompts. Empty `trusted` list delegates to the unfiltered path with no overhead.
- Speech act taxonomy in the crate-level doc comment: maps FIPA-ACL performatives to Mycelium primitives.
- `examples/semantic_coordination.rs` — in-process example demonstrating all three features.
- `GossipAgent::publish_schema(schema_id, json_bytes)` — validates JSON, conflict-detects against the existing `schemas/{id}` KV entry, and writes only on `Published`. Returns `SchemaPublishResult::{Published, Unchanged, Conflict}`.
- `GossipAgent::force_publish_schema` — overwrites without conflict detection; intended for dev / migration tooling.
- `GossipAgent::get_schema(schema_id)` — retrieves authoritative schema bytes from the KV ring.
- `GossipAgent::list_schemas()` — enumerates the full schema catalogue sorted by ID.
- `GossipAgent::seed_schemas_from_dir(path)` — seeds all `*.json` files from a directory tree; file path relative to `dir` (without extension) becomes the `schema_id`.
- `SchemaPublishResult` / `SchemaError` public types.
- `schemas/{schema_id}` added to the KV namespace ownership table.
- Wire v11: `hlc_seq: Option<u64>` added to `WireMessage::Signal` for causal ordering via `emit_ordered()`. v10 rolling-upgrade shim decodes v10 frames with `hlc_seq = None`.
- `emit_ordered()` — stamps an HLC sequence number on the signal frame; receivers with `signal_ordered_delivery = true` buffer per `(sender, kind)` and deliver in ascending HLC order.
- Watcher C2: consolidated requirement opacity watcher — one task and one `cap/` subscription for all declared requirements on a node (previously one task per `declare_requirement` call).

### Fixed

- `publish_schema` / `force_publish_schema` now validate `schema_id` and reject empty IDs, leading/trailing `/`, `//`, `.`/`..` path segments, and non-ASCII characters. `SchemaError::InvalidSchemaId` variant added.
- GC task now proactively evicts closed `prefix_watchers` and `prefix_predicate_watchers` entries on every GC cycle, preventing accumulation of dead senders when the prefix never receives a write after the subscriber drops.
- GC task now evicts orphaned `quorum_trackers` entries (those whose caller future was dropped mid-wait, leaving a dangling tracker with no live waiter).
- Signal reorder buffer now logs a `warn!` when a depth-based flush degrades causal ordering (`max_depth` exceeded). Previously this was silent.
- `rpc_pending` mutex `.lock()` calls now recover from a poisoned mutex rather than panicking, preventing a cascade failure when a panic occurs in a concurrent task.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-06-03

### Added

**Layer I — Gossip KV store**
- Last-write-wins key-value store propagated over TCP gossip
- Hybrid Logical Clock (HLC) causal ordering for all writes
- Anti-entropy sync: nodes reconcile state on reconnect
- Per-key TTL with lazy expiry
- Write-ahead log (WAL) + snapshot persistence; configurable sync modes (none / sync / flush)
- Prefix-based subscriptions with optional predicate filtering

**Layer II — Signal mesh**
- Ephemeral scoped signals with epidemic flood delivery
- Pheromone-style opacity composition: any `sys/load/{node}/...` key with `is_opaque=true` gates signal reception
- Signal scopes: `Node`, `Group`, `Global`, `Groups`
- Dedup via nonce; TTL-bounded forwarding

**Layer III — Epidemic consensus**
- Group-scoped, system-scoped, and cross-group proposals
- `GroupQuorum` for multi-voting-bloc decisions with independent per-group quorum fractions
- Epidemic proposal flood; no coordinator; no external Raft dependency

**Capability and discovery subsystem**
- Node-level `provides` / `requires` capability advertisement via `cap/` KV prefix
- Emergent group membership: nodes self-join groups based on local capability evaluation
- Locality-aware capability resolution with ranking and topology policies
- Group-level opacity and demand pressure tracking
- Inter-group wiring resolved per-emission (`signal_wired_via`)
- Filter opacity watcher with debounce

**Agent state machine**
- `GossipAgent` public API: KV, signals, consensus, capabilities, consistency overlay, sharding
- HTTP management gateway with SSE streaming
- RPC (`rpc_call` / `rpc_respond`), scatter-gather, Actor/Event mailboxes
- Cluster sharding (`shard_for` / `emit_sharded`)

**Consistency overlay (opt-in)**
- `consistent_set` / `consistent_get` — linearisable read-modify-write over gossip KV
- `distributed_lock` — named mutex with TTL-based lease
- `elect_leader` — leader election per named group
- `append` / `scan_log` / `compact_log` / `subscribe_log` / `subscribe_log_group` — ordered durable log with consumer-group cursors

**`--features tls`**
- mTLS peer connections using `tokio-rustls`
- Ed25519 node identity; keypair stored in `sys/identity/{node}`
- Consensus payload signing (`SignedConsensusMsg`)
- `WireMessage::SignedData` for Ed25519-signed KV writes (wire v10)

**`--features metrics`**
- Prometheus scrape endpoint at `/metrics`
- 10 counters, gauges, and histograms covering KV operations, gossip fan-out, signal delivery, consensus rounds
- Grafana dashboard at `dashboards/mycelium-grafana.json`

**`--features a2a`**
- A2A protocol adapter: `/.well-known/agent.json`, `/a2a` JSON-RPC endpoint
- Python and TypeScript `A2aClient`

**`--features llm`**
- Prompt Skills: `PromptTemplate` stored in KV, cross-node invocation via `call_prompt_skill`
- SkillRunner: `.skill.toml` capability-as-skill, OpenAI-compatible LLM driver
- HLC audit trail and OpenTelemetry tracing in SkillRunner
- MCP bridge: server-side tool discovery and routing; client-side tool consumption
- `OpenAiBackend` / `EchoBackend`

**Language bridges**
- Python sidecar bridge (local HTTP, ~1 ms overhead) — see `examples/fluid_pipeline/` and `examples/a2a_langchain/`
- TypeScript sidecar bridge — 28 methods, SSE streaming, full overlay and A2A coverage

**Examples**
- `examples/fluid_pipeline/` — Agentic Flow Networks demo: 10-worker fluid pool, KV ring as distributed buffer, 4-stage article pipeline, PostgreSQL sink. Run with `docker compose up --build --scale worker=10`.
- `examples/a2a_langchain/` — LangChain ReAct agent and AutoGen v0.4 agent auto-discovering Mycelium skills via `/.well-known/agent.json`
- `examples/community/` — 3-node demo cluster with orchestrator, researcher, verifier, and writer skills

**Wire protocol**
- Wire v10 with rolling-upgrade compatibility window (PREV = v9)
- Bincode-encoded framing; version negotiation on every peer connection
